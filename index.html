<p>Hey all, for the second time this week I am going to put off turning in the homework until I am in a place where I can understand it.  I am planning a really fun (and by “fun”, I mean “not fun”) weekend of doing lessons and taking a chunk out of these two homework assignments so ideally on Monday I am in a much better place moving forward.  Thanks for your understanding.</p>
